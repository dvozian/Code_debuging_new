This is my work for IT Project Management.

## Getting Started

To run Phyton code you need to install the home brew. Than to install the Phyton 3 on your machine.
```ex: for Mac OS we need to use "$ brew install python3"```
### Prerequisites

####In my project  I followed the steps bellow:
1. Open the **Terminal** application, found in /Applications/Utilities/
2. Enter the following command into a single line of the terminal:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
3. Hit Return and you’ll see a series of lines about what the script will install and where, hit Return again to agree or hit Escape to cancel.
4. Enter the administrator password (required by sudo execution) to begin installation
Installation of Homebrew will take a while depending on the speed of your Mac and internet connection, as each necessary package is downloaded and installed by the script.
When complete, you will see an “Installation successful!” message.
5. Now you’re ready to install software packages through Homebrew, or you can read the help documentation with the following command:
6. Installing Software Packages through Homebrew on Mac
Installing packages with Homebrew is super easy, just use the following syntax:

```
brew install [package name]
```

For example, to install wget through Homebrew you could use the following syntax:

brew install wget

Simple, easy. Once complete you can run wget as usual.

How to Remove HomeBrew from a Mac
If you have installed Homebrew but later decide you want to remove Homebrew from a Mac for some reason or another, you can uninstall it with another ruby script run from the command line:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"
```

## Running
Once installed you can run the program with the following command
for running my homework assignment "Debug Python"
1. Open the Terminal for Mac OS.
2. Type and pres enter:
```
Debug Python
```
